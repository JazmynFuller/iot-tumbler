# Tumblër

This is a prototype of a responsive website for Tumblër: a smart device that lets users know and control the status of their clothes in the washer/dryer in their home, or at the laundromat.

### Roles
(The names/roles of everyone in your group)

### Tumblër's Social Impact

Tumblër allows users to spend more time with their loved ones or what matters to them, and less time focused on their laundry needs. 
(Paragraph describing the social aspect of the project- what is the reason for doing it? Is there a story behind it? Who is it for? Will it help people? How will they experience the project?)

### Site Structure

### Attach Diagram– Site Map

### Assets
 (List any assets needed: 
 * logo
 * graphics
 * sounds
 * icons
 * animations
 etc.)

### Implementation
(What is your plan to get the work done? Do you have a
   schedule? Do you need specific materials – hardware, software? Do you need to
    learn anything specific? Do you need to use any copyrighted material? Do you
    need to buy anything to get it done?)
    
### Attach Diagram- Wireframes. 
(Have a wireframe for each of the main pages of the site, 3 wireframes, one for each page)

### Jpegs of the final design.
