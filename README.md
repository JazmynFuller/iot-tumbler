### Tumblër's Social Impact

(Paragraph describing the social aspect of the project- what is the reason for doing it? Is there a story behind it? Who is it for? Will it help people? How will they experience the project?)  
  
Tumblër allows users to spend more time with their loved ones or what matters to them, and less time focused on their laundry needs. Checking laundry progress with an app lets them simplify their lives and puts control in the palm of their hand.  
  
Tumblërs can be controlled via mobile phones or tablets remotely – great if they forget to put their wash on before they leave home. For additional convenience, users can have their clothes washed and ready to be hung out as soon as they get in the front door. They can also forget about suffering through the noisy spin cycle; instead they can just set it for when they’re out.  
  
In addition to convenience, Tumblërs are also great for the environment! They can adapt the wash to the amount of clothes that are in the drum, ensuring clothes are washed efficiently no matter the size of the load. Tumblërs can let users know when they needs cleaning or maintaining, which will help the machines last longer.
